                    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                    <p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
                    <p>For the last 12 weeks of the semester, I worked on the 'Grip on Sound' project with 5 groupmates (Tijn, Sef, Luc, Mette &amp; Daan). This project was under the guidance of stakeholder Dennis Kirsch.</p>
                    <p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
                    <p>My task was to research, design and validate design choices made. To then design an app that makes gym teachers aware of long-term noise pollution in gymnasiums.</p>
                    <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
                    <p>In this project too, we first drew up a project plan with research questions, here we divided tasks and I carried out research independently or collaboratively. Thereby I started with library research where conclusions were drawn, based on the results I started designing a first version. Parts of the first version I tested with people from the target group. The results were applied in the following iterations. I did this to improve the design. During the project, we worked with 2-week sprints. At the end of each sprint, we held a retrospective. And halfway through and at the end of the project, we gave each other peer feedback. We did this to see where areas for improvement lie that we can improve during the next sprint.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
                    <p>Overall, the process was good because everyone finished their work on time and the stakeholder was satisfied with the results delivered.</p>
                    <p>Only I did not feel that the outcomes of the retrospective and peer feedback changed much. Those who came late kept coming late and even caused others to come later and later as well. This was also the same for motivation, which was clearly decreasing among the whole group.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
                    <p>While I am satisfied with the results, I personally think we could have done more during the weeks we were given for it. Probably because we only had to deliver a Figma design we spent an unnecessarily long time on this. In my opinion, this reduced motivation. Also because I have already had a project like this several times during my studies. As a result, it felt very much like a repeat. Despite this, I made a lot of progress in my knowledge of Figma during this project. This is something I wanted to improve myself in and can put to good use in my graduation assignment.</p>

                    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                    <p><em>What did I learn?</em></p>
                    <p>I learnt that by creating a research question and multiple sub-questions arise to research. These research can be done using CMD methods. By conducting different research methods, clear conclusions can be drawn.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><em>Did I achieve my learning outcomes?</em></p>
                    <p>Yes, this semester I wanted to broaden my knowledge of Figma, Javascript and preferably know more about frameworks.</p>
                    <p><em>How did I do that?</em></p>
                    <p>By indicating what I wanted to learn during the division of tasks and by giving me the space to do so.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><em>What do I want to change and what do I want to keep doing the same? </em></p>
                    <p>I would mainly proceed in the same way, by first drawing up a project plan with clear research questions and sub-questions. This ensured that I knew exactly what I wanted to research.</p>
                    <p><em>So what are my learning objectives for the future?</em></p>
                    <p>To continue developing my design and code knowledge to become a better media designer.</p>
