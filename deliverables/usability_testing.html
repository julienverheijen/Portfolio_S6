                    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                    <p>This research is be done in the form of usability testing and field trials (done by Daan and Tijn). Users will be served a <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/prototype.html">interactive prototype</a> in which they have to perform tasks based on the app&rsquo;s key features.</p>
                    <p>With this method, we hope to achieve validation on certain design choices in terms of navigation and usability, as well as validating that our app is user-friendly.</p>
                    <p>To do all of this, we will be using <a href="https://maze.co/">Maze</a> for the usability testing to gain digital insights such as click heatmaps, speed in which tasks are completed, and field trials will be done in-person with our target audience to gain insights in how the user experiences the app.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Test tasks and questions</h3>
                    <p>Each task or question has a specific use for me to analyze for results, which is mentioned below the task.</p>
                    <p>We managed to get 27 testers to answer questions and complete tasks. These testers have varying backgrounds, from being IT students to PE teachers.</p>
                    <p>You can see the entire report below</p>

                    <p><strong>What is the current decibel value equal to?</strong></p>
                    <p>From this test we wanted to see if the user could quickly determine what the decibel value was equal to, by comparing them with a decibel range meter and icons for common tasks.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The results of this test are positive, and we feel like the majority of the users understood everything, meaning we don&rsquo;t have to make further changes to this element.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>On the insights page, what is the maximum decibel value measured today?</strong></p>
                    <p>From this test we wanted to see if the decibel graph was readable and user friendly.</p>
                    <p>The results of this test are also positive, as almost all users got the question correct, which means the graph is easy to read and no further changes are needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>On the calendar page, switch to the weekly overview and find out more information about the current activity</strong></p>
                    <p>From this test we wanted to see if the weekly toggle was easy to find, and if users could find the hidden information in the collapsible current activity card.</p>
                    <p>We see that a lot of users were able to instantly click on the weekly toggle and the collapsible activity card once they were on the calendar page, but a lot of users were struggling to find the calendar page.</p>
                    <p><strong>In the day overview, find out more information about the current activity</strong></p>
                    <p>From this test we wanted to see if it was logical that the current activity is highlighted compared to other activities.</p>
                    <p>We see that the &ldquo;highlighted&rdquo; current activity was clicked on a lot more than the upcoming activities, however a lot of testers failed to comprehend the question and didn&rsquo;t switch to the day overview first. The testers that didn&rsquo;t switch to the day overview still were able to click on the current activity, albeit in the weekly overview.</p>
                    <p><strong>On the content page, find the article named &ldquo;Dealing with Hearing Damage&rdquo;</strong></p>
                    <p>From this test we wanted to see if it was easy to find a specific article on the content page.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The result of this test was positive, we noticed that users didn&rsquo;t get lost and found the correct article quickly, however the success rates were a bit inflated because a lot of the page was clicked on by users, but since the elements weren&rsquo;t made clickable in the prototype they were still deemed a &ldquo;direct&rdquo; success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Open question: did you struggle with anything?</strong></p>
                    <p>From this test we wanted to see if there was anything we missed with our tasks and questions.</p>
                    <p>We received mostly positive, mixed results where the majority of the users mentioned they didn&rsquo;t struggle while navigating through the app and thought the design was user-friendly and well thought out.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Some feedback we managed to get from the open questions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The maximum decibel value was tough to find at first</li>
                    <li>Finding information about the current activity. There could perhaps be a button on the homepage &gt; current activity (or the name of the activity) without having to go to the calendar.</li>
                    <li>It was quite clear and uncluttered! only it would be nice if you could visit the different pages (contents or insights) from each page. Now I had to click back every time I wanted to go to another page</li>
                    <li>What does the number of percent have to do with the decibel level, this is not quite clear to me at the moment</li>
                    <li>I didn't think it was clear on that article page that it was a category and not already an article, otherwise a very nice design!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Others felt like everything was clear and intuitive.</p>

                    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                    <p>In general, the design was well received by users and was given mostly positive feedback. We see that some design flaws could be improved, mostly in terms of navigation.</p>
                    <p>Some of the design changes that we should make based on these test results are:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>There should be a better indication of whether the weekly or daily overview is active on the calendar page.</li>
                    <li>The buttons during the onboarding process should be placed a bit higher.</li>
                    <li>Ensure there is a clear distinction between the daily dose ear and the decibel value comparison chart.</li>
                    <li>Design the content page in a way that it separates article groups from actual articles.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We also noticed that some questions weren&rsquo;t asked correctly, resulting in skewed results on some tasks. We realize that this impacts our analysis, but we also looked at heatmaps and other data to see how skewed these results actually were.</p>
                    <p>The open-question feedback highlighted a generally positive user experience, with specific suggestions for improvement, such as adding a direct button for the current activity on the homepage and enhancing page navigation. Despite minor issues, the majority found the design clear and user-friendly. These insights will be valuable for refining the app's interface and addressing specific user concerns.</p>
