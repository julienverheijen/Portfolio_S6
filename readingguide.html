                <p> 
                    During the personal project, I made a personal portfolio in the form of a working website. The portfolio is used to show how I reached the learning outcomes, which research methods I used, the results and the conclusions. Besides the portfolio, there needs to be a reading guide for quick and easy navigation through the portfolio.
                    <br><br>
                    For that reason, I came up with the main research question:
                    How to create a scalable portfolio to present the projects to stakeholders and teachers in a visually appealing way?
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="readingGuideTitle" id="theProjectsInternational">International</h3>
                <p> 
                    During the international project, the whole class visited the Dutch Design Week and collaborated with students from Humber College, Toronto (Canada). The goal was to get inspired by the different exhibitions and come up with a creative concept for the narrative 'Products & Craft Design'. 
                    <br><br>
                    We also travelled to Malaga (Spain) where I attended the 2-day WeWeWeb conference, where several speakers spoke and shared their UI knowledge and latest design trends with the audience.

                <p> 
                    During this project, we were put in a group of 6 advanced Media Design students. And we had to choose a project to work on, our choice was the 'Grip on Sound' project. The project aims to make PE teachers in primary and secondary schools aware of the long-term excessive noise level in gymnasiums. This leads to concentration problems, hearing loss, headaches, and even tinnitus. A previous ICT Advanced Media Design group has designed a smartwatch app to give teachers insights during lessons. It is up to us to design a mobile app that works with the smartwatch app and provides a more comprehensive insight before or after gym classes. This project is led by Dennis Kirsch and involves several groups from other ICT specialisations.

                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To get a clear understanding of the project, I wrote a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/projectplan.html">project plan</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">. This describes the scope, research questions with research methods and overall planning for the first 3 weeks.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To answer the main research question, the sub-questions had to be answered first. To answer the first sub-question &quot;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/research_navigation.html">How can users easily navigate through the portfolio?</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&quot;, I researched the <span style="color:#51C3C3;">focus group</span>. In combination with a <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">literature study</span>, I was able to conclude the different types of navigation options that could work for this target group.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">In order to answer the second sub-question &quot;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/research_scalable.html">How to make a portfolio scalable?</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&quot;, I found out more about frameworks through a <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">literature</span> study. Through an <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">expert interview</span>, I concluded that it takes too much time to learn a framework properly in one semester and therefore use Vanilla JavaScript.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To answer the third sub-question &quot;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/research_visual.html">How do I make a portfolio visually attractive?</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&quot;, I conducted a <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">literature study</span> to find out more about the latest design trends, typography and visual attractiveness. Through <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">benchmark creation</span>, I got the inspiration to create two different wireframes through <span style="color:#24BFED;">sketching</span>. <span style="color:#FFD11D;">Co-reflection&nbsp;</span>gave me new ideas that were applied in a high-fidelity <span style="color:#24BFED;">prototype</span>. This prototype was tested in a <span style="color:#797DBC;">usability test&nbsp;</span>with people from the target group. The results of the test have revealed improvements that could be made to the design. It has also given new insights that can be added for a better user experience.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To deconstruct the portfolio website, I use the <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/c4_model.html">C4-Model</a>. Through <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">literature study</span> and a <span style="color:#FFD11D;">peer review</span>, I was able to visualise the structure at a container level 2.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/portfolio_development.html">develop the portfolio</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a <span style="color:#24BFED;">proof of concept</span>. This allowed me to test whether all functions could be realised or whether another alternative had to be found.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To learn more about JavaScript animations, I followed the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/broken_car_challenge.html">broken car challenge</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">. Through <span style="color:#24BFED;">tinkering</span>, I was introduced to Vite and GSAP.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:Poppins;">To look back at how I acted during the personal project, I wrote a <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/personal_reflection.html">reflection</a> using the START methodology. This allows me to know what went well and what I would do differently next time to become a better media designer.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To come up with a concept together for the <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/common_grounds.html">Common Grounds</a> project, we came up with a concept through <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">literature study</span>, <span style="color:#24BFED;">ideation</span> and <span style="color:#24BFED;">storytelling</span>. We <span style="color:#FFD11D;">pitched</span> this to the other groups through a video.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To come up with an idea for the narrative &ldquo;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/products&craftdesign.html">Products &amp; Craft design</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&rdquo;, we created an <span style="color:#EF4E8C;">inspiration wall</span> of everything we saw during Dutch Design Week. This helped us get an insight into what everyone saw. To visualise the concept, we used a <span style="color:#24BFED;">paper prototype</span>. We <span style="color:#FFD11D;">pitched</span> this concept in the form of a video, which allowed us to receive feedback.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To learn more about UI and the latest design trends, I participated in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/weweweb.html">WeWeWeb</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;conference. Here, I heard the <span style="color:#A8CE3B;">best, good &amp; bad practices</span> from various speakers. This has given me new knowledge and insights.</span></p>

                <p> 
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To get a clear understanding of the project, we wrote a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/group_projectplan.html">project plan</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">. This describes the scope, research questions with research methods and overall planning for the entire project, which ensures that we are on the same page as the stakeholders.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To answer the sub-question &ldquo;How can the app&rsquo;s UX/UI be optimised for both Apple and Android users?&rdquo;, I did a&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#A8CE3B;">trend analysis&nbsp;</span>to know the latest&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/ux_ui_design_trends.html">UX/UI design trends</a></span>&nbsp;for mobile apps to improve the user experience and put you one step ahead of competitors.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To answer the sub-question &ldquo;How can we test the UX/UI of the app?&rdquo;, We did a&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#A8CE3B;">literature study&nbsp;</span>to know which different&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/ux_ui_testing_methods.html">UX/UI Testing Methods</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;exist and what would be the best method to gain the most useful results.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To know which requirements should be reflected in the design, we added up a <span style="color:#EF4E8C;">requirements list</span>. As not all items are equally important, we used the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/moscow_method.html">MoSCoW method</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;to divide up the requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To answer the sub-question &ldquo;How can we test the UX/UI of the app?&rdquo;</span>, I conducted an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/a-b_testing.html">A/B test</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;with the target audience. By using the <span style="color:#797DBC;">A/B testing</span> method, we now know which design creates the most awareness.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To present our idea to the stakeholders, we created an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/prototype.html">interactive prototype</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;through <span style="color:#24BFED;">sketching</span> and <span style="color:#24BFED;">prototyping</span>. This allowed us to explain exactly how the app should work.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To answer the sub-question &quot;How can we ensure that the app maintains a good UX?&quot;, I conducted a <span style="color:#24BFED;">usability test</span>. The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/usability_testing.html">usability testing</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;is needed to validate the design.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To make good progress, we did a <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/scrum_standups.html">scrum stand-up</a> with the group daily, and with the stakeholders every other week. As a result, we knew exactly what everyone was working on and where extra help was needed.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To effectively reflect on our work and project progress, we held&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;"><a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/retrospectives&peerfeedback.html">retrospectives and peer feedback</a></span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;sessions at the end of each sprint. This has ensured that I know what goes well and what can be improved next time.</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To present our project, we did an <span style="color:#FFD11D;">expo</span> of our <span style="color:#24BFED;">proof of concept</span> for visitors at <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/innovation_insights.html">Innovation Insights</a> to experience what it feels like to be in a room with a lot of noise pollution just like the gym teachers also experience. We did this by playing a loud sound of playing children in a gym hall and showing a live dB meter with an icon where&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;color:#1E1E1E;">decibel levels&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Poppins;color:#1E1E1E;">are equal.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family:Poppins;">To transfer the project in an organised way, we have prepared an <a href="https://i410544.hera.fhict.nl/portfolio_s6/deliverables/advisory_report.html">advisory report</a>. This contains the research methods we used, results we found, conclusions drawn and the follow-up steps to be taken to reach the next TRL.</span></p>

                    During this project, I did a lot of research to make better design choices. The planning of the project plan was well pursued and therefore I am very satisfied with the result. I am glad that the research has made me decide not to use a framework for now, which has allowed me to broaden my knowledge of Javascript first. The use of JSON during this project ensured clarity and less code. But it also brought limitations. That's why I want to look for other alternatives in the future. There are still points for improvement. But overall, I am very satisfied with how the project went.

                    During the international projects, I had a short time to get to know the international students, which we immediately started working with. The communication was easy, and we were able to create a nice concept in a short amount of time.

                    Throughout this project, I worked independently and collaboratively with several people in the group to design a smartphone app. Working with scrum allowed us to make good progress and everything was finished on time and a satisfied stakeholder.
