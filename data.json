By creating the main question 'How to create a scalable portfolio to present the projects to stakeholders and teachers in a visually appealing way?' several sub-questions arose. Among them, 'How can users easily navigate through the portfolio?', 'How to make a portfolio scalable?' and 'How do I make a portfolio visually attractive?'. For each sub-question, the right research methods were chosen, allowing me to prepare for the research and make a groblal planning of how I wanted to organise the first weeks to get off to a good start.

Through a conversation with people from the target group, I was able to conclude that the portfolio does not need a large menu structure. By knowing all this information, I can conclude that there are multiple options for navigation and there is no best navigation option, all options have their pros and cons. The horizontal, hamburger and full-screen navigation menus are the best options for this target group and this project. A later design test will reveal which menu option is best suited for this situation.",

On the 3rd day, we threw together all the photos we had taken and things that have remained with us. we noticed that many of the projects we had seen were on sustainable topics. For this reason, we were going to think of a product that we might see at next year's Dutch Design Week.
