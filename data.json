      "results": "Through the project plan, I created an overview to know exactly what I was going to do in the first 3 weeks of the personal project. By creating the main question 'How to create a scalable portfolio to present the projects to stakeholders and teachers in a visually appealing way?' several sub-questions arose. Among them, 'How can users easily navigate through the portfolio?', 'How to make a portfolio scalable?' and 'How do I make a portfolio visually attractive?'. For each sub-question, the right research methods were chosen, allowing me to prepare for the research and make a groblal planning of how I wanted to organise the first weeks to get off to a good start. Through the scope, I indicated what I would finish these first three weeks and what I wouldn't.",
      "conclusion": "By drawing up a project plan, neither myself nor Bardt will face any surprises, because what is expected of me has already been checked in advance. The project plan also ensures an organised approach, making it easier to achieve the goal.",

I also know the different types of navigation that exist, and what the benefits are for each type. Through a conversation with people from the target group, I was able to conclude that the portfolio does not need a large menu structure. By knowing all this information, I can conclude that there are multiple options for navigation and there is no best navigation option, all options have their pros and cons. The horizontal, hamburger and full-screen navigation menus are the best options for this target group and this project. A later design test will reveal which menu option is best suited for this situation.",

        "conclusion": "Frameworks can have major advantages, allowing objects that repeat more often in the portfolio to be created faster and better, and they can also be adjusted more easily. The biggest disadvantage is that it takes more time to learn and understand how these frameworks work. For this reason, I chose not to use a framework and to realise this with Vanilla JavaScript only.",

On the 3rd day, we threw together all the photos we had taken and things that have remained with us. we noticed that many of the projects we had seen were on sustainable topics. For this reason, we were going to think of a product that we might see at next year's Dutch Design Week. We came up with the following concept 'Bag2Nature', a bag made of natural waste such as orange peel. We made a paper prototype of this idea which we could use to visually reinforce our pitch video.",
