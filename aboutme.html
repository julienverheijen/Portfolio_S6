            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I am Juliën Verheijen, 25 years old and living in Venlo. I am currently in the final year of my HBO ICT course at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven, where I focus on Media Design with a specialization in Smart Mobile. 💻</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my study, I learn to devise and realize creative solutions for different target groups independently and in groups using design methods. I use the Adobe CC tools and various programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin and Swift. 👨🏽‍💻</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to my studies, I work as a freelancer under the name Juuve Media for the media agency Media Monkeyz. Here I am the specialist in the field of video and I do both production and editing for various customers. I also support colleagues in designing visuals. 📷</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am very motivated to further expand my knowledge and improve my skills as a media designer, because I am still far from where I want to be. Hopefully I can do something for you that will benefit you or your (potential) customers and allow me to grow my portfolio! 🚀</p>
