                    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                    <p>The test was prepared using <a href="https://maze.co/">Maze</a>. And was sent to several test takers, including the target audience. A total of 29 responses were received, which is enough to conclude.</p>
                    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" src="https://app.maze.co/report/Percentage-test/ar8sf4tlp8dekmh/intro/embed" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>Because some questions required the test persons to fill in an answer themselves, I have translated the answers into a diagram where it becomes clear what most test persons choose.</p>
                    <p>The test subjects were first shown an image with 3 different designs for 5 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>After 5 seconds they get the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Which design stuck with you the most?</li>
                    <li>And why do you think it stuck with you?</li>
                    <li>Which one felt most like you have to take action?</li>
                    <li>And why?&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The following answers came out of this.</p>
                    <img class="text-img" src="../assets/images/ab-1.png">
                    <img class="text-img" src="../assets/images/ab-2.png">
                    <p>We can see that over 2/3 of testers found the smiley design stuck best and left almost like you have to take action.</p>
                    <p>In the next 2 questions, testers were shown the image with the design accompanying the question. in doing so, they had to answer the question:</p>
                    <p>Which design would you rate as most insightful for a daily maximum decibel intake? And Which design raises the most awareness in you?</p>
                    <img class="text-img" src="../assets/images/ab-3.png">
                    <img class="text-img" src="../assets/images/ab-4.png">
                    <p>This showed that over 69% of the testers rated the ear design as most insightful for a daily maximum decibel intake.</p>
                    <p>Also, 3/5 of testers found the ear design to be the most awareness-raising.</p>
