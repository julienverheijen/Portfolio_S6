                    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                    <p>An article by <a href="https://www.icoderzsolutions.com/blog/mobile-app-uiux-design-trends/">A. Sudra (2023)</a> and <a href="https://www.designstudiouiux.com/blog/mobile-app-ui-ux-design-trends/">Design Studio (2023)</a> discusses the mobile app design trends of 2023 and beyond. Some trends that may be of interest to our project are listed below.</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li><strong>Passwordless login</strong></li>
                    <p>By using an account (such as Google, Facebook, Apple) or biometric authentication (such as facial recognition or fingerprint) when logging in, the user does not have to create and remember new passwords. This makes logging in easier and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="2">
                    <li><strong>Flat Design</strong></li>
                    <p>Emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and functionality, this minimalist design approach employs vibrant colours, striking typography, and sleek lines to craft a dynamic interface. The flat design eschews gradients and shadows, opting for minimal textures and straightforward shapes, which in turn guarantees that responsive designs load swiftly and efficiently.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="3">
                    <li><strong>Minimalism</strong></li>
                    <p>Similar to flat design, the primary focus lies in achieving clarity, simplicity, and functionality. This style incorporates ample white space, a restrained colour scheme, minimal imagery, and crisp typography. While it offers certain advantages, the scarcity of visual elements can present a challenge, making it at times tricky to distinguish between different interface components, resulting in a less intuitive user experience.&nbsp;</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="4">
                    <li><strong>Neumorphism</strong></li>
                    <p>Neumorphism is a new design trend that merges with flat designs. It creates a modern aesthetic. It can be used in many ways, for buttons and icons, creating a conscientious UI. It demands careful finishing of contrast, typography and colours so that the UI remains accessible to the target audience.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="5">
                    <li><strong>Asymmetrical Elements</strong></li>
                    <p>According to the article, this is one of the most popular mobile UI trends, where elements are deliberately arranged unevenly. This can be through line thickness, dimensions, contrast colours and different shapes.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="6">
                    <li><strong>Bottom Navigation</strong></li>
                    <p>This is reflected in most apps. And is very much liked by users as it gives easy one-handed access to key functions. This trend can be used to display about 4 to 5 destinations, which can be labelled with text or an icon.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="7">
                    <li><strong>Dark Mode</strong></li>
                    <p>The use of dark backgrounds and light text reduces eye strain on the user and improves battery performance.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol start="8">
                    <li><strong>Glassmorphism</strong></li>
                    <p>These are semi-transparent or fully transparent backgrounds with hazy glassy effects. This creates a 3D effect and gives a layered feel and look. This style can be combined with flat and minimalism, for a striking and visually appealing design.</p>
                    </ol>
